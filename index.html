                        I need to make it a mission, not a job.

                    <h5>Vission</h5>
                    <p>
                       A vision and mission statement is a paragraph that covers everything I want to be, want to do, and want to do in my career. 
                       It determines what success and excellence look like to me. It expresses my vision for where I want to be in the future and it reflects my values, goals and objectives and how I want to work.

                    <h5>Goals</h5>
                    <p>
                        When setting personal goals we should first take stock of where we already are. Perhaps you have done quite well financially,
                        but your personal relationships are severely lacking. We need to take an honest assessment of where we have succeeded and 
                        where we have failed. Then we can determine how to proceed forward.
